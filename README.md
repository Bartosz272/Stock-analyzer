    #### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/5rMmKnHwA2Y
    #### Description:
    This code is a simple way to tell you if you should sell your stock, buy more or try to hold it.
    It uses bollinger bands, and if the price is above them you should sell it,
    below them buy it, and if its in the middle try to hold on to it.
      (when I traded a little bit during one of the courses on my uniwersity this method worked)
    At first when you start this code a window shows up and it asks you to put in ticker of a company you want to analyze
    they should be the same as on : finance.yahoo.com
    but they can be lower case, and if you make a mistake also nothing happends.
    When you put in correct ticker new window shows up telling you what should you do,
    and also a graph showing the bands and SMA (Simple Moving Average) for 20 days, and of course the price.
